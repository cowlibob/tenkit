# Tenkit 天気ト

![Gem](https://img.shields.io/gem/v/tenkit)
![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/superbasicxyz/tenkit/ruby.yml)

A wrapper for Apple's WeatherKit API in Ruby

A portmanteau of "tenki" the Japanese word for weather, and "kit", the end of WeatherKit.

This project is in beta, some of its API may be unstable, or possibly non-functional (like WeatherKit itself). We recommend pinning the version in your Gemfile until we get to a stable release, at which point we will be using [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## Installation

Add to `Gemfile`

```
gem 'tenkit'
```

See Apple's instructions on how to [Get Started with Weatherkit](https://developer.apple.com/weatherkit/get-started/). Your WeatherKit API dashboard should be at this URL <https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/services/weatherkit>.



## Usage

See [Credentials](#credentials) for information on how to obtain the configuration values below.
```ruby
Tenkit.configure do |c|
  c.team_id = ENV["APPLE_DEVELOPER_TEAM_ID"]
  c.service_id = ENV["APPLE_DEVELOPER_SERVICE_ID"]
  c.key_id = ENV["APPLE_DEVELOPER_KEY_ID"]
  c.key =  ENV["APPLE_DEVELOPER_PRIVATE_KEY"]
end

client = Tenkit::Client.new

lat = '37.323'
lon = '122.032'

client.weather(lat, lon)
```

## Credentials

Once obtained, these values should be kept secret.

For Ruby you might use ENV variables, or a .env file **not committed to git**.

Rails projects will likely store these values encrypted in [custom credentials](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html#custom-credentials), which can be commited to git.

### APPLE_DEVELOPER_TEAM_ID
This is your Apple Team ID, taken from the top-right of your [developer account certificates page](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list):

### APPLE_DEVELOPER_SERVICE_ID
This is a Service ID that you’ll need to create: https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list/serviceId It will be in the same style as an App ID, as a reverse domain name, e.g. “uk.co.cowlibob.fancypantsweather”

### APPLE_DEVELOPER_KEY_ID
Generate a new key: https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/authkeys/add Give it a name (not important but descriptive to you) and make sure to check “WeatherKit”

Make sure you download the key and keep it safe for the next credential. Use the generated Key ID as the value for `APPLE DEVELOPER KEY ID`.

### APPLE_DEVELOPER_PRIVATE_KEY
This is the freshly downloaded private key, a .p8 file. P8 is a format that presents the private key in plain text (.p12 is a binary format). You may have seen these before, they look something like this:

```text
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAA
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
```
